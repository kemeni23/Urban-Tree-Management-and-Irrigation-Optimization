Urban Tree Management – Are the trees in Düsseldorf prepared for the changing climate?

Climate change is leading to increasingly hot and dry weather in many places. This year marks a special point in time: The summer of 2023 was record-breaking with its high temperatures - and is now actually the hottest by far since records began in 1940. Cities are particularly vulnerable to heat because the heat builds up between the narrow buildings and there is often a lack of shady and thus cool places. This also affects urban trees, which have to be particularly resistant to survive under the changing and increasingly harsh conditions.

How well a tree copes with drought or frost depends not only on factors such as age, location and the like, but also on the tree species. For this reason, we have consulted the KLAM rating, which classifies the different tree species according to their drought and frost resistance. To make the trees somewhat more comparable, we decided to select only trees that were newly planted between 2019 and 2022 and are thus all still very young. This means that their roots are not yet as mature and are more likely to rely on a high water supply than older trees with deeper roots.

On a map showing the city area of Düsseldorf, we have marked all recently planted trees. According to their KLAM rating, they are divided into three colors: green, orange and red. Green-colored trees are more resistant to drought and frost than red-colored trees. In addition, each tree has a pop-up window in which further information about the tree can be viewed: The tree species, the planting date, and the groundwater level of the nearest measuring station.

In addition, we have created a second map that shows both recently planted trees (green-colored) and trees that recently had to be cut down (black-colored). For these trees, a pop-up window displays information about the reason why the tree had to be cut down.

The python code to create the maps can be found in the Jupyter Notebook “20230915_Map_tree_location.ipynb”. All libraries and datasets that are needed are stated in the beginning on the Notebook. The datasets can be found in the folder “datasets” in this GitHub repository.
